## Embedding a YouTube Video

You've heard of [YouTube][youtube], right? To embed a YouTube video, use its URL with the `{embed YouTube video}` insert:

```
Tell me if you've seen this one before.

{embed YouTube video: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0'}
```

<aside data-hint="working">
For now, it's not possible to have a YouTube video start when a passage displays. The player will need to begin playback.

Accessibility features for video will be added to a future release of Chapbook.
